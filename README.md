Development platform:
OS: Windows 10, Game Engine: Unity 2020.3.18f1, Visual Studio 2019

Project Description:
An object (player) is controlled by arrow keys (up,down,left,right) or WASD. The object should always be in the middle of the screen.
The player can collect and deliver other objects (packages). The player can only "take" one package at a time and must deliver it somewhere.
Only after delivery can another package be collected.
Packages should always appear in different places and can be collected again.
